# j-neuralflow
An Artificial Neural Network Library, still under development. All versions for other languages would be created like nerualflow.js... etc

After downloading the package, copy to your development enviroment for usage.

usage:

import neuralflow as nf

ann = nf.ANN
ann.neural_network(feature_sets, weight_x, weight_y, bias_x, bias_y, bias_value, label_shape_x, label_shape_y, lr, i, label, seed)
ann.predict()
